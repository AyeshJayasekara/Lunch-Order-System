# Lunch Order System

This system is a part of an in-house application I developed for demonstration purposes. (Currently not in use) 

Configurations : Usual Laravel configurations to be done.
Additional Configurations : DB tables are to be migrated. Read how to migrate databases from Laravel documentation. For more personalized experice you will have to update the locations table with your own locations which applies to your scenario.
